# Lab 8: ICMP Lab

## Objective
Learn how to recognize and analyze ICMP packets using Wireshark. This lab demonstrates the functionality of the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), which is used for network reliability and error reporting.

---

## Lab Purpose
ICMP is a key protocol within the TCP/IP suite, enabling devices to send error messages and network status updates. Unlike other protocols, ICMP does not transport data. This lab focuses on analyzing ICMP packets, specifically the **echo request** and **echo reply** packets generated by the `ping` command.

## Lab Setup
- **Tools**: VirtualBox (optional), Wireshark, and Command Prompt.
- **Network**: The lab requires internet connectivity or an internal network for pinging.
