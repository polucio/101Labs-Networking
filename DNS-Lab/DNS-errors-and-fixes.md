# Errors and Fixes: DNS Lab

This file documents the errors encountered during the DNS Lab and the steps taken to resolve them. These notes aim to help troubleshoot similar issues in the future.

---

## 1. **Error: Duplicate IP Address**
- **Symptom:** Received `%IP-4-DUPADDR: Duplicate address` error during router configuration.
- **Cause:** The same IP address (`192.168.1.1`) was assigned to multiple devices or interfaces.
- **Fix:**
  1. Verified IP address assignments for all devices in the lab.
  2. Changed the conflicting IP address on the router's interface.
  3. Re-tested connectivity with `ping` to ensure the issue was resolved.

---

## 2. **Error: Interface Down**
- **Symptom:** Router interfaces showed `administratively down` or `protocol down` in the output of `show ip interface brief`.
- **Cause:** Interfaces were not enabled or had no connected cable.
- **Fix:**
  1. Used the `no shutdown` command on each interface to enable them.
  2. Verified that all cables were properly connected.
  3. Rechecked the interface status to ensure they were `up/up`.

## 3. **Error: PC Cannot Ping Router**
- **Symptom:** The PC timed out when pinging the router's interface.
- **Cause:** Incorrect gateway configuration or unconfigured DNS settings on the PC.
- **Fix:**
  1. Verified the PC's static IP configuration, ensuring it was in the same subnet as the router interface.
  2. Set the correct default gateway (routerâ€™s IP).
  3. Retested by pinging the router from the PC.

## 4. **Error: DNS Hostname Unresolved**
- **Symptom:** PC displayed "Host Name Unresolved" when querying the DNS server.
- **Cause:** DNS server was not configured with the required A record.
- **Fix:**
  1. Enabled the DNS server feature on the router using `ip dns server`.
  2. Created an A record with `ip host www.mypage.com 192.168.1.2`.
  3. Re-tested DNS queries from the PC.

## 5. **Error: Unable to Access Telnet**
- **Symptom:** Telnet to the router failed or prompted for incorrect credentials.
- **Cause:** VTY lines were not configured properly.
- **Fix:**
  1. Configured VTY lines with `password cisco`, `login`, and `transport input telnet`.
  2. Verified the router's Telnet accessibility from the PC.
  3. Ensured Telnet was enabled on the correct interfaces.

---

## 6. **Error: Invalid Command in Configuration Mode**
- **Symptom:** `% Invalid input detected at '^' marker` error appeared for certain commands.
- **Cause:** Commands were issued in the wrong mode (e.g., global config vs. interface config).
- **Fix:**
  1. Verified the appropriate mode for each command (e.g., used `configure terminal` for global commands).
  2. Exited to the correct mode before reissuing the command.

---

## 7. **Error: VLAN Unassigned and Down**
- **Symptom:** VLAN1 remained `administratively down`.
- **Cause:** VLAN1 was not assigned an IP address or brought `up`.
- **Fix:**
  1. Skipped configuring VLAN1 since it was not required for this lab.
  2. Focused on enabling and configuring FastEthernet interfaces.

---

## 8. **Error: Show Command Fails in Config Mode**
- **Symptom:** `% Invalid input detected` when using `show` commands in configuration mode.
- **Cause:** Show commands cannot be executed in configuration modes (e.g., `config` or `config-if`).
- **Fix:**
  1. Exited to privileged EXEC mode using `end` or `exit`.
  2. Re-executed the `show` commands in privileged EXEC mode.
